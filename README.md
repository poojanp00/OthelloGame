# OthelloGame

## General Overview
The modern board game, Othello, is a commercially produced version of a game that originated in the 19th century called 'Reversi'. It's an interesting 2-player game of strategy played on an 8x8 grid in which each player places tokens on the board in order to cover more grid cells than their opponent. Each token is a two-sided disk with white on one side and black on the other. The basic premise of the game is that as each player plays a token of his/her color (white or black), they 'flip' over all the intermediate tokens of their opponent. The game ends when all the grid cells have been covered with tokens, or no allowable move can be made. This program models this game in python using turtle graphics.
